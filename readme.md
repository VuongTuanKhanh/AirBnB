# Udacity airbnb house price prediction 
Udacity project for Data Scientist 2022
## Introduction

This project was motivated by instructors in Udacity platform  

I had my whole weekend thinking about what will be first topic in medium blogspot so I take a look of some suggestion in the platform to do analyze about house price in [airbnb Boston dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/boston). You can visit my full medium blog in [here](https://medium.com/@vuminhduc1809/airbnb-house-price-prediction-bcd3db4f72a)

I would be analyzing airbnb dataset based on several question: 

    - What is the most common neighbor in the dataset ?
    - In which month, do people usually spend on vacation?
    - What is the distribution of homestay prices in Boston?
    - Which factor will affect the price most?

*Conclusion* : what a findout was rather interested, the price is highly correnlated to the location of the homestay, which mean homestay with higher cost tend to stay together in the specific area, probably to utilize the same geographical advantages.
